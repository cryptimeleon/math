/**
 * A framework for dealing with group/boolean/exponent expressions that supports the use of variables.
 * <p>
 * The expressions can contain variables which allows the storage of expressions where not all variables are
 * known at the time of creation.
 * In that way, an expression allows one to store a function.
 * <p>
 * The expression can also be analyzed to obtain information about the whole expression at once.
