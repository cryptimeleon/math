## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `DebugGroup` group operation counting data is now split up into buckets that allow, for example, to separately count operations done by different parties in an interactive protocol. Furthermore, counting is now done statically, i.e. the data in each bucket persists across `DebugGroup` instances.

## [2.1.0]

### Added
- Algorithm selection for debug groups

### Fixed
- `IntegerRing.decomposeIntoDigits` sometimes worked incorrectly

## [2.0.0] - 2021-06-23

### Added
- Additional operator overload methods added to `ExponentExpr`
- `BasicBilinearGroup` wrappers for the implemented bilinear groups
- Convenience methods for the vector classes
- `square`, `div` and `valueOf` convenience methods for `Zn` and `Zp` classes
- PRF classes from Craco now are part of Math
- `ByteArrayImpl`, a byte array implementation

### Changed
- Renamed "counting" group classes and package to "debug"
- Made supersingular and Barreto-Naehrig implementation classes package-private (except those that are relevant to the user)
- Made internal lazy group classes package-private
- Adjusted some tests to work with the new package-private classes
- Made representation handler classes package-private and moved the classes up a package
- Made ring group impl classes package-private and moved inv and neg cost estimation to the `Ring` interface
- Improved performance of finite field multiplication

### Fixed
- Fixed `decomposeIntoDigits` method of `IntegerRing`

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-01

### Added
- Initial release
